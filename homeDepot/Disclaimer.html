<h2>CAD - Canadian dollar</h2>
<div class="padB10">
Canada's dollar is the fifth most held reserve currency in the world, accounting for approximately 2% of all global reserves, 
behind only the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen and the pound sterling.[4] The Canadian dollar is popular with central banks because of 
Canada's relative economic soundness,
 the Canadian government's strong sovereign position, and the stability of the country's legal and political systems

<h2>USD - United States dollar</h2>
<div class="padB10">
The U.S. dollar was originally commodity money of silver as enacted by the Coinage Act of 1792 which 
determined the dollar to be 371 4/16 grain (24.1 g) pure or 416 grain (27.0 g) standard silver. 
It is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's primary reserve currency.[8] Several
 countries use it as their official currency, and in many others it is the de facto currency.[9] Besides the United States,
 it is also used as the sole currency in two British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean: the British Virgin Islands and Turks and
 Caicos Islands. A few countries only use the Federal Reserve Notes for paper money, 
while the country mints its own coins, or also accepts U.S. coins that can be used as payment in U.S. dollars, such as the Susan B. Anthony dollar.

<h2>EUR - euro</h2>
<div class="padB10">
The euro (sign: â‚¬; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the 28 member states of the European Union:
 Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,
 Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.[3][4] The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four
 other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by
 some 337 million Europeans as of 2015.[5] Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.
